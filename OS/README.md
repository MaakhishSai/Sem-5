# **Operating Systems (OS)**

This repository provides an overview of key topics in Operating Systems, including design strategies, process management, memory management, file systems, and virtualization. Below is a breakdown of the content:

---

## **1. Overview and Device Management**
- **Operating System Fundamentals**:
  - Review of operating system strategies: resources, processes, threads, and objects.
  - Organization of operating systems: design factors, functions, and implementation considerations.
- **Device Management**:
  - Characteristics of devices, controllers, and drivers.
  - Approaches to device management, including buffering and device drivers.
  - Typical scenarios such as serial communications and storage devices.

---

## **2. Process Management**
- **Processes and Scheduling**:
  - System view of processes and process address spaces.
  - Process and resource abstraction, including process hierarchies.
  - Scheduling mechanisms for uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems, with various strategies.
- **Synchronization and Coordination**:
  - Interacting and coordinating processes using semaphores.
  - Deadlock:
    - Prevention.
    - Avoidance.
    - Detection and recovery.

## **3. Memory Management**
- **Memory Management Concepts**:
  - Memory allocation and dynamic relocation.
  - Various memory management strategies.
- **Virtual Memory**:
  - Paging and segmentation:
    - Issues and algorithms.
    - Typical implementations of paging and segmentation systems.

## **4. File Management and Virtualization**
- **File Management**:
  - File storage abstractions, memory-mapped files, and directory implementations.
  - Protection and security:
    - Policy and mechanism.
    - Authentication and authorization.
  - Case study: Unix and Linux kernel.
- **Virtual Machines**:
  - Virtual machine monitors and their role.
  - Issues in processor, memory, and I/O virtualization.
  - Hardware support for virtualization.
