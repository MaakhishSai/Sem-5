## **2. Database Management Systems (DBMS)**
Here, you'll find an overview of DBMS concepts such as data modeling, relational databases, transaction processing, and indexing. Topics include:
- Entity-Relationship (ER) and Enhanced ER models
- Relational algebra, relational calculus, and SQL
- Data storage and indexing using B-trees and B+ trees
- Database design, normalization, and functional dependencies
- Transaction processing and database security

---

## **3. Machine Learning (ML - Theory)**
This section explores key concepts in machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Topics covered are:
- Fundamental Machine Learning Techniques
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Machine Learning Models and Optimization
- Advanced techniques like ANN and CNN.

---

## **4. Theory of Computation (TOC)**
Theory of Computation delves into the theoretical aspects of computation, including automata theory, formal languages, and computational complexity. Topics include:
- Regular languages and automata (DFA, NFA, regular expressions)
- Context-free languages, CFL-PDA equivalence
- Turing machines, decidability, and the Church-Turing Thesis
- Complexity theory: NP-completeness and PSPACE completeness
