# **Theory of Computation**

Theory of Computation is a foundational topic in theoretical computer science that explores the capabilities and limitations of computational systems. This subject is structured into the following key units:

---

## **1. Regular Languages and Automata**
- Basic concepts of **Languages**, **Automata**, and **Grammar**.
- **Regular Languages**:
  - Regular expressions and their equivalence with Finite Automata.
  - Myhill-Nerode Theorem and DFA State Minimization.
  - Pumping Lemma and proof for the existence of non-regular languages.

---

## **2. Context-Free Languages (CFLs)**
- **CFL-PDA Equivalence**:
  - Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages and proof for the existence of non-Context-Free languages.
- **Algorithms and Theorems**:
  - CYK Algorithm for membership in CFLs.
  - Deterministic Context-Free Languages (DCFLs).
  - Chomsky-Sch√ºtzenberger Theorem.

---

## **3. Turing Machines and Decidability**
- **Turing Machines**:
  - Recursive and recursively enumerable languages (Turing-decidable and Turing-recognizable languages).
  - Universality of Turing Machines and Church-Turing Thesis.
- **Chomsky Hierarchy**:
  - Classification of formal languages: Regular, Context-Free, Context-Sensitive, and Recursively Enumerable.
- **Undecidability**:
  - Undecidable problems and reducibility.
  - Recursive and recursively enumerable sets.

---

## **4. Complexity Theory**
- **Time and Space Complexity**:
  - Complexity classes (e.g., P, NP, PSPACE).
  - Hierarchy Theorems.
- **Reductions and Completeness**:
  - Problem reductions.
  - NP-completeness and PSPACE-completeness, with examples.

This structured overview serves as a guide to understanding the critical concepts in the Theory of Computation.
